# ✊ SoeiroTech Lab Manifesto

**Design is form. Code is structure. Real solutions are born from the union of both.**

## 🎨 Origins

I'm **Márcio Soeiro** — a graphic designer by training, a web developer in continuous transition and growth.

For years, I worked on visual identities, branding systems, and cohesive design experiences. But I was always drawn beyond the surface: **into the internal logic behind ideas**.

The **SoeiroTech Lab** was born from this fusion: **the visual reasoning of design** combined with the **constructive logic of software development**.

## 💡 Purpose

At SoeiroTech Lab, every project has a mission:

- **Turn complexity into clarity**
- **Build useful, accessible and purposeful tools**
- **Learn by doing and share through documentation**

---

## 🔍 Core Principles

### 1. Ethics & Transparency  
Open-source code, documented decisions, respect for everyone — users, learners, contributors.

### 2. Clarity & Organization  
Modular architecture, clear documentation, and a user-centered approach.

### 3. Accessibility & Inclusion  
Interfaces made for all. Technology is only complete when it includes everyone.

### 4. Lifelong Learning  
Every project is a learning lab. Mistakes are documented lessons.

## 🔬 Why “Lab”?

Because this is where things are **tested**.  
This is where ideas are **built from scratch**.  
This is where innovation begins.

---

## 🌱 The Path Forward

SoeiroTech Lab is not a static portfolio.  
It’s a **technical journal**, a **learning lab**, an **incubator of real-world solutions**.

Welcome to the journey.
